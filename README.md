## Docker Learning Projects

This repository contains several hands-on Docker projects built to practice containerization, orchestration, and multi-service development.
Each project explores a different aspect of Docker, from single-service containers to multi-container applications using Docker Compose. 

The repository includes the following projects:
- CoderCo Multi-Container Challenge (Flask + Redis)
- hello_flask (Flask + MySQL)
- node.js (Simple node.js web app)

Each section below describes what I built, my approch, what I learned, and the challenges I solved.
